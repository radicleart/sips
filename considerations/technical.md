## About this CAB

The technical CAB reviews SIPs related to technical implementations to the blockchain, including consensus-breaking changes. SIPs that are technical in nature and must be vetted by users with the relevant technical expertise belong in this SIP track.

## Considerations

### In-scope

The following items would be considered in-scope for this CAB:

1. Changes to Clarity syntax and semantics
2. Changes to Clarity functions or keywords
3. Changes to the Stacks blockchain’s consensus mechanisms
4. Changes to the Stacks blockchain’s wire formats
5. Changes to the networking protocols in the Stacks blockchain
6. Proposed standards for Clarity contracts

### Out-of-scope

The following items would be considered out-of-scope for this CAB:

1. Changes to the consensus protocol that are strictly limited to financial or economic considerations

### Questions for SIP Review

1. Are there any consensus consequences for the proposal? If so, what are they?
2. What components of the network are impacted?
3. What are the activation requirements? Can non-technical users participate in activation?

_Note: above considerations subject to changes and iterations from ongoing lessons learned_

## Bylaws

We choose to adopt the bylaws Steering Committee member @jcnelson set out in this doc: https://gist.github.com/jcnelson/3fcc635ede20ce98d1eae60941eb127a

Starting from those bylaws, this CAB will continue to evaluate what works, what doesn't work, and use the feedback and lessons learned to improve the process and increase involvement along the way.
